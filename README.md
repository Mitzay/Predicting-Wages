# Predicting-Wages
## 📘 Project Description

This project explores the factors that influence an individual’s wage and builds predictive models to estimate wages based on demographic, educational, and occupational characteristics. Using the provided dataset, the analysis investigates how variables such as age, education level, job experience, industry, and other socioeconomic attributes contribute to wage differences.

The study follows a structured data science workflow starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by feature preparation, and then the development of machine learning models to predict wage outcomes. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in income distribution and create a model that can reliably estimate wages for individuals given their profile.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Conduct EDA to understand relationships between personal attributes and wage levels.
- Prepare and preprocess data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, or tree-based algorithms.
- Identify the most influential predictors of wage variation.
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Modeling
- Model Evaluation & Comparison
- Correlation & Trend Visualization

## 💡 Key Insights

The analysis highlights how education, experience, and demographic characteristics shape wage outcomes. These insights can support workforce planning, career decision-making, and socioeconomic research.
